DONE: Bottom clearing for new algo with pointy cutters
DONE: Separate tip clearing from gear cutting
* Stand-alone tip-clearing with optimization (maybe keep mill in place and use rotation only?)
* Add cut strategy capability to reorder/modify cuts
* Change to tooth-based description instead of full polygon
* Add backlash parameter
PARTIAL: Improved sequencing of cuts to minimize movement of mill (sort by rotation?)
PARTIAL: Avoid outputting angles that cause 360 degree rotation
  - what was the exact issue?   (something like G0 A350 // G0 A-10?)
* Add cutters that have flat & rounded tips (like gear cutters)
* Make gear cutter work
* Cleanup gcode_vars
  - make gears and tools know how to output / load from gcode_vars
* Use gcode loop instead of outputting gcode for every tooth
* Make render generate zoomed and non-zoomed results at the same time
* Move /tmp/anim_opt.gif into local directory
* Generate movie files instead of GIFs
